# common-crawl-project
Just a little project playing with common crawl

The objective of this projiect is to find all hyperlinks in a common crawl, and record the origin and destination pairs in a database

An ETL process then converts this into:
1. The number of links that link toward a domain name
2. A list of domains that link towards a domain name
